The SmartIrrigate project is a smart irrigation system designed to optimize water usage in agriculture. It uses sensors to monitor soil moisture levels, weather data, and crop requirements, adjusting irrigation schedules in real time to conserve water and improve crop yield. The system aims to reduce water wastage, lower costs, and promote sustainable farming practices through automation and data-driven insights.
